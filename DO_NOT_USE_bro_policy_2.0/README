This set represents the current best efforts of bro policy for isshd analysis.  

Some experimental aspects include sqlite plugin as well as the TSTREAM support.

For the input framework, it is best to use the backwards compatible version - 
sshd_input_stream-bc.bro as it is the most up to date.

In addition, a new set of policy has been written which supports the use of 
a cluster model for ssh analysis.  Thise scripts are identified with a
*_cluster.bro .

More documentation is forthcoming.
